# Installation

1. Compile .ipa or download from [here](https://github.com/hizinfiz/Maid-Dragon-iMessage-stickers/releases)
2. If you're fancy and have a Developer account, you can sign the ipa, and you're done!
3. If you're not fancy like me, download [Cydia Impactor](http://www.cydiaimpactor.com).
4. Plug in your device, make sure it's selected, and drag the .ipa into the Impactor window.
5. Impactor will prompt you for your Apple ID and password.
    * You may need to visit appleid.apple.com to create an app specific password
6. Once Impactor has finished doing its thing, open your Settings app > General > Profiles & Device Management > Developer App (you should see your Apple ID here) > Trust
7. Enable the app in Messages
8. ???
9. Profit!
